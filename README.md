# Cryptocurrency_portfolio

Project name: **Cryptocurrency Portolio**

Project contains 3 sheets:
Portfolio, Graphics and Crypto_API_data

The idea behind this project was to create a **sample cryptocurrency portfolio** that allows for easy and transparent tracking of assets, 
enabling timely decisions for buying or selling. To achieve this, the project connects to the **CoinGecko API** to monitor cryptocurrency price changes in real time. 

A separate graph provides a graphical overview of the percentage distribution of each cryptocurrency within the portfolio, 
as well as a chart that tracks the changes in the current holding value of each cryptocurrency compared to its purchase price.

In the near future, the project will be further enhanced, and the graphical component will be expanded using **Power BI**. 
I also plan to provide a more detailed description of the project in the form of a report.
